            Hello! My name is Juhi Raghavan and I created this website
            with one goal in mind: to help young girls gain real world
            skills that are often not taught in schools. I participated
            in the Global Youth Excellence & Leadership program (GYEL)
            where I learned about many global issues through the lens of
            the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 5: Gender Equality
            especially resonated with me as I learned about all the inequalities
            that women face around the world. By starting small and teaching 
            about life skills, I hope to equip girls with the confidence and
            tools they need to navigate everyday challenges, become independent,
            and step into leadership roles, no matter their background. This is
            just the beginning of this website and I canâ€™t wait to expand it more
            and empower more women!
        </p>
